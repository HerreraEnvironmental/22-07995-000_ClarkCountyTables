## Project Description {#project-description}

This script renders 36 summary tables for the Clark County Shore Project. 
There are 18 tables of Canopy Cover information, and 18 tables of Impervious Cover information.

## :droplet: Location in Herrera Database {#location-in-herrera-database}

The original, unmodified data used in this project is located in the "data_raw" folder within this repository. Please use the "Revised" excel sheet, which should be the correct sheet used in the script.

That folder is backed up to: `K:\Projects\Y2022\22-07995-000\Table\`

If you do not have access to the data, please contact the emails listed at the bottom of the repository.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements and Dependencies {#requirements-and-dependencies}

Below is a list of packages and external softwares that this project utilizes.
Please ensure you have the package(s) installed and have access to the tools listed below.


```{r packages, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
packages.table <- "

cat(packages.table)
```

## :computer: Installation and Usage {#installation-and-usage}


In order to run this script and recreate the analysis, you will need to have R and Rstudio installed on your computer.
All the data produced by this analysis can be found in the data_secondary/ folder, while all figures can be found in the figures/ directory.

### :arrows_counterclockwise: Layout of directory and data

This repository is organized into a main.Rmd markdown script, which produces the results from scratch when run in its entirety.
The main script references folders of raw data (data_raw/), and produces results data that has been modified or created by the analysis (data_secondary/, figures/).
All analysis scripts are contained in the R/ directory.
The extras/ folder contains an image of the original template for the data, created in Excel.

The data_raw/ folder is **READ ONLY** and should never be modified or deleted.

### :heavy_check_mark: Detailed description of data and analysis

The raw data consists of an Excel sheet of canopy and impervious coverage data for 18 watersheds. The analysis loads and tidies the data, then splits by watershed and creates new summary columns for each category. The category columns are then pasted together to form "Acres, (%)" columns. 

Once each table has been created, a loop knits, renders and saves the tables in LaTeX to the figures/ folder as pdfs.
